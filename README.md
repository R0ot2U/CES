# CES
With a similar concept to [RES](https://github.com/honestbleeps/Reddit-Enhancement-Suite) (Reddit Enhancement Suite) but for Salesforce's Chatter hence the name CES (Chatter Enhancement Suite)

## Why?
So this is largely an experiment for me to get better at Chrome APIs mainly but also try and develop a number of little things to make my day easier navigating and using chatter. 

## Goals
* Locally Stored Notes on Users
* User Tags
  * Cross Org Linking (By Email Address)
* Bookmark All (Follow All) existing Chatter threads on a record  
* RemindMe functionality (Scheduled Reminders, Reminder List)
